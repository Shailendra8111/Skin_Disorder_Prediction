# Domain Analysis
Erythema : Erythema is redness of the skin or mucous membranes, caused by hyperemia (increased blood flow) in superficial
           capillaries. It occurs with any skin injury, infection, or inflammation.

Scaling :  Scaling skin is the loss of the outer layer of the epidermis in large, scale-like flakes. The skin appears dry 
           and cracked.

Itching : Itchy skin is an irritating and uncontrollable sensation that makes person to scratch to relieve the feeling.
          Possible causes for itchiness include internal illnesses and skin conditions.
        
Koebner phenomenon : The Koebner phenomenon may result from either a linear exposure or irritation. 

Polygonal papules: A papule is a raised area of skin tissue thatâ€™s less than 1 centimeter around. A papule can have 
                   distinct or indistinct borders.

Follicular papules : folliculitis is usually bacterial in origin (like boils), resulting in red painful papules and pustules.
                     It clears with antibiotics. 

Oral mucosal involvement : A group of autoimmune diseases is characterised by autoantibodies against epithelial adhesion 
                           structures and/or tissue-tropic lymphocytes driving inflammatory processes resulting in specific
                           pathology at the mucosal surfaces and the skin. The most frequent site of mucosal involvement in 
                           autoimmune diseases is the oral cavity.
                
PNL infiltrate : Pulmonary infiltrate - Pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia (PIE), also called eosinophilic pneumonia,
                 is a syndrome associated with a variety of clinical entities, only some of which have an infectious cause
                 Pulmonary eosinophilia with transient, peripheral pulmonary infiltrates and minimal symptoms has been 
                 associated with Ascaris, Strongyloides, and hookworm infections.
                
Exocytosis : Exocytosis is the process of moving materials from within a cell to the exterior of the cell. This process 
            requires energy and is therefore a type of active transport. Exocytosis is an important process of plant and
            animal cells as it performs the opposite function of endocytosis .
            
Acanthosis : A skin condition characterised by dark, velvety patches in body folds and creases. Acanthosis nigricans is 
             a medical sign characterised by brown-to-black, poorly defined, velvety hyperpigmentation of the skin. 
             It is usually found in body folds, such as the posterior and lateral folds of the neck, the armpits, groin, 
             navel, forehead and other areas. It is associated with endocrine dysfunction, especially insulin resistance 
             and hyperinsulinaemia, as seen in diabetes mellitus.
            
Hyperkeratosis : The main symptom of hyperkeratosis is thickened skin that feels rough to the touch. Other symptoms may be
                 present with hyperkeratosis depending on the type. For example, if a person has keratosis pilaris, a hereditary
                 type of hyperkeratosis, they may also experience redness in the affected skin area. 
            
Parakeratosis : Parakeratosis is a skin condition, or dermatosis, which is characterized by the appearance of small, slightly
                red plaques, covered with scales or very thin white skin. They can appear anywhere on the body .
        
Spongiosis : The main symptom of hyperkeratosis is thickened skin that feels rough to the touch. Other symptoms may be present 
             with hyperkeratosis depending on the type. For example, if a person has keratosis pilaris, a hereditary type of
             hyperkeratosis, they may also experience redness in the affected skin area. 
             
All remaining columns are few more features to understand the condition of the skin .

# Challenges faced 
 All the features aare related to medical field which are very difficult to understand even after spending time on domain 
   analysis .

 And they didn't mentioned the exact disease name , they just mentioned class 1 to 6 . so , it's a bit difficult to relate 
   the respective fature with type of skin disease .

 Other than that didn't faced any issue with data and data handling .
# Conclusion :
We did prediction using 4 machine learning models namely  Logistic Regression, KNN, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree.

All 4 models predicted the target variable with good accuracy  .

Among these models, KNN and  Logistic Regression models gave more reliable results and can be implemented further .
